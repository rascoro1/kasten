Tomatoes should be planted no earlier than spring frost. And should be harvestable ~10 weeks after planting.

It is typically recommeneded to start growing indoors before spring frost.


Should be staked to reduce the plant from touching the ground, this can cause issues with mold and diseases. This opens the realm to have many different ways of staking.


## Types
- [Determinate](1602358961-gardening-tomatoes-determinate.md)
- [Indeterminate](1602359149-gardening-tomatoes-indeterminate.md)

## Pruning
Should start as planting time as you remove all lower stems that will come in contact with the soil.
Remove any drooping li,bs that are close to the soil.
I prefer using scissors as they can easily remove branchs without twisting or pulling.
Remove to allow more sunlight or air.
