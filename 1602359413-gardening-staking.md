Staking is typical for plants that vine such as tomatoes.

There is a couple different approaches for vining:
- single stake: One stake that is placed within an inch or 2 on the plants base. Tie the plant to the stake once it reaches ~1ft.
- Double stake: same thing as above but just an extra stake. This can be helpful for large 
- Cage: Cone shaped wire cages. No need to tie tomatoes to the cage.
- Florida Weave: Less stakes, but string in between the stakes. The tomatoes will grow around the strings and use the strings as support.
