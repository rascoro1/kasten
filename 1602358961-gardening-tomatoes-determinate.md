Are normally stockier, less aggressive vines and fruit quickering,

These tomatoes are easier to maintain since they will not vine out and sufficate other plants. 

Can grow in a dense canopy and doing pruning to allow for more sunlight and air is beneficial.

Staking is still recommened but is not always required.
